Jul 31 1999: xtoolwait 1.3 released

	* If a window is destroyed before xtoolwait has examined it,
	  xtoolwait would exit with a BadWindow error. This error is
	  now ignored by xtoolwait.
	  Thanks to Jeff Sheinberg for reporting this bug and to
	  Martin Bialasinski for helping to debug.

Sep  2 1998: xtoolwait 1.2 released

	* Added the -pid option.
	  Idea and initial code by Oron Peled <oron@actcom.co.il>.

Jan 12 1997: xtoolwait 1.1 released

	* Updated the documentation: use the -mappings option once to
	  detect the virtual desktop.
	* Removed the xtoolplaces patch since it has been integrated
	  in the official xtoolplaces distribution available at
	  http://mammoth.lle.rochester.edu/~adam/Progs/programs.html

Oct 15 1996: xtoolwait 1.0 released

	* Updated the documentation: window manager must be started
	  first.
	* Adapted the xtoolplaces patch to the latest release (1.4a).
	* Bumped up version number. Believed to be rock stable.

Dec  1 1995: xtoolwait 0.3 released

	* xtoolwait demanded that the window manager had completed its
	  initialisation, which is often not true. Fixed.

Nov 30 1995: xtoolwait 0.2 released

	* xtoolwait now compiles under SunOS 4.1.x too :-)
	* xtoolwait failed to detect window mappings under tvtwm. Fixed.
	  Reported by Dick Snippe <D.M.Snippe@el.utwente.nl>.
	* Window mappings generated by other X clients are ignored.
	* Fixed a possible file descriptor leak.
	  Reported by Malte Uhl <malte@Mathematik.Uni-Bielefeld.DE>.
	* Added the -mappings option.
	* Added the -version option.

Oct 12 1995: xtoolwait 0.1 released
